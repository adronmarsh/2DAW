echo "<p>Anakin Skywalker was a legendary human Jedi Knight, who served the Galactic Republic during its last days, and later became the Sith Lord Darth Vader. He was the son of Shmi Skywalker. During his adult life, he became the secret husband of Senator Padm√© Amidala of Naboo, and the father of legendary Jedi Luke Skywalker and Leia Organa Solo. He was also the grandfather of Ben Skywalker, Jaina, Jacen, and Anakin Solo. He was the great-grandfather of Allana, and ancestor of Nat, Kol, and Cade Skywalker.</p>";
echo "<p>Although he would later become one of the most important individuals in the galaxy, Skywalker came from extremely humble origins. He spent the early days of his life on Tatooine, as a slave, as did his mother. In the year 32 ABY, Skywalker met Jedi Master Qui-Gon Jinn. After gaining his freedom, secured by Jinn in a bet, and having won the Boonta Day Race, Jinn took Skywalker away from Tatooine to begin training him as a Jedi, although Shmi Skywalker was left on the planet, something his son always regretted. Skywalker was an important part of the Battle of Naboo, destroying the Android Control Station, aboard an N-1 Starfighter, despite his young age at the time. Soon after, he joined the Jedi Order, becoming Obi-Wan Kenobi's Padawan. Skywalker was believed to be the Chosen One, of the Jedi prophecy, an extremely powerful individual, who was to bring balance to the Force, destroying the Sith sect, and that was how the Jedi High Council accepted him into training, despite the rules dictated in the Jedi Code.</p>";
